## Systems Analysis

The next analysis is through the web scrapping to the link https://www.imdb.com/calendar/?ref_=rlm&region=US&type=MOVIE which show the next releases in the cinema for the next years and some movies from the last two years

The analysis was made for select the best movie in the future depending on the genre and the year the user want to watch it. How for those movies there arenÂ´t rating or stars the filter must be different, we focus on the genres based one the companions the person will be, if the people who accompain the user is under 15 years the system will select the appropiate genre for all the public

The components that i took in account were the years of the person, it could be a big error if someone underage see a movie about horror, even , could make a complaint.

It's neccesary this component

The sensible component is the year, the releases of the movie is not clear the genres of the movies so if the page (IMDb) make a change of a genre the system will have the same action, so the system is flexibly
